Key Metrics Overview
Total Airlines Tracked: 176

Detailed Insights
1. Flights Based on Distance Groups
The majority of flights occur within short-haul distances, with:

1.4M flights traveling less than 500 miles.

Flights in the 500–999 miles range accounted for 727K flights.

There is a sharp decline in the number of flights as distance increases, reflecting an operational focus on short- to medium-haul routes.

2. Top 10 Carriers by Transported Passengers
Southwest Airlines Co. and Delta Air Lines Inc. dominate with over 8,000K passengers each.

Other leading carriers include Continental Airlines, US Airways, and SkyWest Airlines, highlighting a competitive market among large players.

3. Top Routes Based on Number of Flights
The most traveled routes are:

Atlanta, GA – New York, NY with 5.46K flights.

Boston, MA – New York, NY and Washington, DC – New York, NY follow closely.

Major urban corridors, especially in the Northeast U.S., are key contributors to flight volume.

4. Load Factor Analysis
Load Factor by Carrier Name indicates operational efficiency:

Delta Air Lines leads with a 19.5% load factor.

Followed closely by Southwest Airlines Co. at 18.9%.

Lower load factors among smaller regional carriers suggest opportunities for operational improvements or market repositioning.

5. Load Factor: Weekday vs Weekend
Weekday operations dominate with 71% load factor compared to 29% on weekends.

This reflects strong business travel demand during weekdays, indicating potential for targeted weekend leisure promotions.

Strategic Recommendations
Expand Short-Haul Operations: With high flight volumes under 500 miles, further strengthening short-haul services could boost passenger numbers.

Optimize Weekend Offerings: Since weekend load factors are lower, introducing targeted promotions or leisure packages could increase weekend utilization.

Focus on Top Routes: Enhance services and customer experience on the top-performing routes to maintain and grow market share.

Improve Load Factors for Regional Carriers: Analyze and restructure underperforming routes or explore partnerships to improve load factors.
